# ELF Fundamentals 

ELF (Executable and Linking Format) is the Linux and unix executable file type

An ELF file consists of an ELF header and ELF data. It can be examined using the readelf command

An ELF header contains important information for the OS on how to handle the file. Here are the most important 
parts of the header 

- It starts with the following hex sequence 7f 45 4c 46

- Class defines the target architecture 

- Data refers to the type of endianness (little or big)

- Type can be CORE (core dumps), DYN (shared objects), EXEC (executables) or REL (relocatable files)

- Core dumps are products of memory corruption. They can be fed to gdb in order to examine crashed programs
more accurately. We will use core dumps later on during exploit development


Before we move on to the remaining three types, we need to first understand what linkers and loaders are


Linkers are responsible for taking the names of functions and linking them to their actual locations in memory. 
During a call to a function, the linker is responsible for location its memory address within a system library
and then writing it to the process memory of the executable, so that the function can be accessed at that address. 
The task of a loader is to load programs from storage into memory
